\# Designing a Beginner AI Cybersecurity Tool



This short article introduces a very simple concept: using AI-like logic to help detect suspicious or hidden text inside files. It is designed for beginners learning how AI can support cybersecurity.



\## Why This Matters

Attackers often hide text inside files to bypass scanners. Even a simple rule-based AI can assist by identifying strange patterns or encoded data.



\## Example AI Logic

The script checks for:

\- Base64-encoded text

\- Long unreadable strings

\- Hidden characters



\## Demo Script

The Python demo script included in this project:

\- Reads any text file

\- Detects suspicious patterns

\- Shows a simple “AI” decision



This is appropriate for beginner students learning cybersecurity and AI foundations.
